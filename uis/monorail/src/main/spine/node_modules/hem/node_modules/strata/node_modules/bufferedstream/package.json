As of this\nwriting there are several different types of streams in node, including some\nobjects that do not actually inherit from Stream. The goal of this library is\nto iron out the differences between the various stream-like objects and give\nuser code a reliable, documented API they can use now. If the situation ever\nimproves in node core (which we all hope it will) this code may become obsolete.\n\n## Installation\n\nUsing [npm](http://npmjs.org):\n\n    $ npm install bufferedstream\n\n## Usage\n\nThe key feature of this class is that anything you write to the stream in the\ncurrent tick of the event loop is buffered until the next tick. This allows you\nto register event handlers, pause the stream, etc. reliably without losing any\ndata.\n\n    var BufferedStream = require('bufferedstream');\n\n    var stream = new BufferedStream;\n    stream.write('Hello ');\n    stream.pause();\n\n    setTimeout(function () {\n      stream.write('IHdvcmxkLg==', 'base64');\n      stream.resume();\n      stream.on('data', function (chunk) {\n        console.log(chunk.toString()); // Hello world.\n      });\n    }, 10);\n\nThe `BufferedStream` constructor may also accept a \"source\" which may be another\nstream that will be piped directly through to this stream or a string. This is\nuseful for wrapping various stream-like objects and normalizing their behavior\nacross implementations.\n\nPlease see the source code for more information. The module is small enough (and\nwell-documented) that it should be easy to digest in a quick skim.\n\n## Tests\n\nRun the tests with [mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/):\n\n    $ mocha test\n\n## License\n\nCopyright 2011 Michael Jackson\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nThe software is provided \"as is\", without warranty of any kind, express or\nimplied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability,\nfitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.
