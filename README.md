Indy is a simple repository manager for [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) and other build tools using the Maven repository format.

After building, a variety of standalone application launchers are available:

To use a launcher, simply unpack it to the directory of your choice (it will create an `indy` subdirectory). Then, run `bin/indy.sh`.




For more information, see [the Indy Docs](http://commonjava.github.io/indy/).
